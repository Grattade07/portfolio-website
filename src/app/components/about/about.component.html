    <p id="about-description">
      I am a self-taught software engineer specialising in frontend development.
      <br />
      Having initially spent time learning the basics of programming on my own,
      I quickly discovered my passion for the subject and enrolled in a bootcamp
      to further my learning and then completed my journey to begin a career in
      tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am always looking to further my own learning through exposure to new
      concepts and technologies.
      <br />
      I enjoy tackling problems, and collaborating to create responsive webpages
      and provide a positive user experience.
      <br />
      I am currently working on building intuitive applications at Cordic.
